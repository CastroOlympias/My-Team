# My-Team

## Description
  This app is a command line team builder app, which outputs an html file to dist folder. I copied the css style and index.html to the root so it could be viewed on git pages, but it can only be created through the command line.

* refactored code, not a whole lot needed. Through the response answer from enquirer, part of the anchor tag in the choice selection, is created, being added to the template html js file using template literals. The html template js file then finishes the anchor tag with the user input that completes the chain of the hyper link, in the first to screenshots.

* Recently I realized these graphic icons are just emojis so I added the emojis for employee type which then appears on the web application.

## Story
  Coding is pretty cool and so learning what you can do basically adds another tool to the tool box of apps and code.

## Installation
  In your terminal run: npm init, npm install inquirer, and npm install --save-dev jest.

## Usage
  in the command line, to run the test enter: npm test, or to create your team enter: node index.js.

## Authors
  Just myself.



## Resources
  While I have a link to Bulma css frame work, I created a very simple, mobile friendly css that I think spaces the grid better than Bulma, between each card, effectively, you can have infinite columns in the row, the cards for each team member is hard coded in size for larger screens, which prevents them from stretching which can get really weird; however. When screen size for mobile devices is a factor, the cards do have some stretching due to relative size via % of the view port. This makes for a better experience of all screen sizes.

## Testing
  just run: npm test to test the employee.js concept file.
