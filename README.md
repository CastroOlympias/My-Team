## Description
  This app is a command line team builder app, which outputs an html file to dist folder. I copied the css style and index.html to the root so it could be viewed on git pages, but it can only be created through the command line.

## Resources
  While I have a link to Bulma css frame work, I created a very simple, mobile freiendly css that I think spaces the grid better than bulma. effectively, you can have aninfinit column in the row and the flex as the view port changes.
